# Agent Instructions

- Keep code edits minimal and focused on the task at hand, matching existing Texas Instruments DSP project conventions.
- If a change affects hardware interaction or build steps, include a short comment or note explaining the impact.
- In final responses, provide a concise summary of changes and clearly state which tests were run (or note if none were run).
